      "Ben was very thorough in his work and honest, we enjoyed him and his help. We did a whole house remodel. They were on time and discussed every detail with us and shared his advise if he felt I might be making the wrong choice which was very helpful. The wood look tile floor was a huge job and he worked around us so we could stay here till last minute. It is beautiful the kitchen counter tops and backsplash and my shower he tiled are beautiful as well. We recommend him highly all his work is excellent. We highly recommend Ben and Kin remodeling for anything you need.",

      "We were in a bind and could not get a new bathtub to properly line up to the existing drain. We called 4-5 companies but Ben was the only one who answered his phone and set up an appointment on the spot. He came over, looked at the situation and gave us a quote the same day. We agreed to the price and he was there Monday at 9 AM as promised. It took him 1???? days to complete the project as he estimated. He set the new tub, removed an old closet and moved it back a few inches, soldered the new copper pipes, etc. Cleaned up after himself and was very pleasant to work with. I would hire Ben again!",

      "Ben saved a do it yourself project gone wrong. A leaking toilet in the bathroom rotted the subfloor and was damaging the ceiling of the room below. Ben removed the existing tile floor, flange and the damaged subfloor. Then repaired the subfloor, installed a new flange and creatively solved a plumbing issue, then laid new tile down. Finally, he reset the toilet and repair the ceiling in the room below. Very friendly and professional. I would recommend this company for sure.",

      "He is the best contractor we have worked with!! We originally hired Ben to install subway tile in our bathrooms. We were so impressed with his work - and genuinely impressed with him as a person, that we ended up hiring him to do a lot more. At one point I was literally just finding projects for Ben because I didn't want to lose him to other customers. (We were renovating a Short North Home) Ive grown up in this business.. my dad is a general contractor.. and I do a bit of contract work for family and friends. I have also flipped houses and have a few rentals.. so I have worked with all kinds of contractors. It is extremely extremely rare to find such a skilled contractor that is honest and genuinely cares about doing things right. Ben went the extra mile on numerous projects for us (even when we didn't ask him to). He actually cares about doing things RIGHT! His pricing is more than fair for the quality and care of work. I wish I could give him more stars. You will not be disappointed if you hire B & Kin Remodeling!",

The project cost a bit more than I had anticipated, but this was due to the volume of cabinets and the intricacy of the locks themselves. All in all, I am very pleased with the results, and would absolutely hire Benjamin again.",

I felt very comfortable from the time I met Ben. I have other projects to be done and I plan to hire Ben and his team to do them. Their price was very reasonable and the job they did was worth every penny.",
